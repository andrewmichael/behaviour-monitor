# IMPORTANT: Home Assistant must be installed separately
# For testing with Home Assistant, you have two options:
#
# Option 1: Install a minimal HA core (may have compilation issues on some systems):
#   pip install homeassistant
#
# Option 2: Use the Home Assistant development container:
#   See README-DEV.md for instructions on using devcontainer
#
# Option 3: Test within an existing Home Assistant installation:
#   Copy this integration to your HA's custom_components/ directory
#   and run tests from within the HA environment
